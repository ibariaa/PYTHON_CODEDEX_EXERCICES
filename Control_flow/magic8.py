# The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940s for fortune-telling and advice seeking. ðŸŽ±
# It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:
# Yes - definitely.
# It is decidedly so.
# Without a doubt.
# Reply hazy, try again.
# Ask again later.
# Better not tell you now.
# My sources say no.
# Outlook not so good.
# Very doubtful.
# Create a magic8.py program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.

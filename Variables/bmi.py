# The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in certain populations.
# It is computed by taking an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters
# Create a bmi.py program that calculates your own BMI.
# Author's note: Psst. BMI is an archaic and oversimplified way to measure personal health. It was created by a mathematician — not a doctor! 💡

bmi = 70 / (1.6 ** 2)
